    <h1>This is a H1 Heading.</h1>
    <h2>This is a H2 Heading.</h2>
    <h3>This is a H3 Heading.</h3>
    <h4>This is a H4 Heading.</h4>
    <h5>This is a H5 Heading.</h5>
    <h6>This is a H6 Heading.</h6>

    <p>
      The decision to have six levels of headings in HTML, rather than more or
      fewer, was made to strike a balance between providing enough flexibility
      for structuring content and keeping the markup simple and intuitive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having too many heading levels could lead to confusion and make it more
      difficult for developers to choose the appropriate level for their
      content. On the other hand, having too few levels might not provide enough
      flexibility for representing the structure of complex documents.
    </p>

    <p>
      six levels of headings (h1 through h6) cover a wide range of scenarios,
      from the most important heading (typically representing the title of the
      page) to subheadings and subsections. This structure has proven to be
      sufficient for most web content while remaining manageable and easy to
      understand.
