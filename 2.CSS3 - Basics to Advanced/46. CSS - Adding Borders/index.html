    <h1>Kingdom of Denmark</h1>
    <p class="para1">
      Denmark covers an area of 42,916 km², making it slightly larger than the
      Netherlands, or slightly less than twice the size of the US state of
      Massachusetts. Denmark, country occupying the peninsula of Jutland
      (Jylland), which extends northward from the center of continental western
      Europe, and an archipelago of more than 400 islands to the east of the
      peninsula. Jutland makes up more than two-thirds of the country’s total
      land area; at its northern tip is the island of Vendsyssel-Thy (1,809
      square miles [4,685 square km]), separated from the mainland by the Lim
      Fjord. The largest of the country’s islands are Zealand (Sjælland; 2,715
      square miles [7,031 square km]), Vendsyssel-Thy, and Funen (Fyn; 1,152
      square miles [2,984 square km]). Along with Norway and Sweden, Denmark is
      a part of the northern European region known as Scandinavia. The country’s
      capital, Copenhagen (København), is located primarily on Zealand; the
      second largest city, Århus, is the major urban center of Jutland.

    <p id="para2">
      The country has a population of 5.7 million people (in 2016). Capital and
      largest city is Copenhagen. Spoken languages are Danish and some German.
      English is the predominant second language. Faroese is spoken in the Faroe
      Islands, Greenlandic in Greenland, as mentioned, both dependencies of the
      kingdom.

      Denmark's political system is that of a constitutional monarchy, where the
      monarch formally appoints a representative to preside over the creation of
      a coalition government following a parliamentary election. Chief of state
      is Queen Margrethe II of Denmark (since 14 January 1972), in theory the
      source of all executive and legislative power. But de facto the Danish
      constitutions of 1849, and the most recent of 1953, ended the absolute
      monarchy and introduced parliamentary democracy. Head of government is the
      prime minister, he presides over the cabinet. The parliament of Denmark,
      the Folketinget is the supreme and ultimate legislative body in the
      country.

      Denmark experiences changeable weather because it is located in the
      temperate zone at the meeting point of diverse air masses from the
      Atlantic, the Arctic, and eastern Europe. The west coast faces the
      inhospitable North Sea, but the terminal section of the warm Gulf Stream
      (the North Atlantic Current) moderates the climate. Lakes may freeze and
      snow frequently falls during the cold winters, yet the mean temperature in
      February, the coldest month, is about 32 °F (0 °C), which is roughly 12 °F
      (7 °C) higher than the worldwide average for that latitude. Summers are
      mild, featuring episodes of cloudy weather interrupted by sunny days. The
      mean temperature in July, which is the warmest month, is approximately 60
      °F (16 °C).
