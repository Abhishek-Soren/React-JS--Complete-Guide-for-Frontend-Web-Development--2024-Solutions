          <h1 id="head2">Beautiful Places in the World</h1>
          <p>
            Our planet is covered in stunning destinations—with both manmade and natural
            features—but there are some locations that truly stand out from the rest. Whether you're
            more of an outdoorsy person or you prefer to stroll paved city streets when you go on
            vacation, there's so much beauty in the world that you need to see firsthand. We've
            narrowed down our picks for the most beautiful places in the world to visit, and we
            think at least some of them belong at the top of your travel bucket list.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to seeing worldly wonders, photos simply don't do these places justice. If
            you think Jaipur, India, or Cartagena, Colombia, look gorgeous in the photos below, then
            just imagine what they'll look like in person. However, we're not telling you to drop
            everything and buy plane tickets right this minute. As with any vacation, you'll need at
            least some sort of itinerary, which is why we've added helpful links to make the process
            that much easier for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            if you're not sightseeing from an interior design point-of-view, these incredible
            destinations will serve as amazing sources of inspiration that you just can't get
            anywhere else. From Lake Como, Italy, to Joshua Tree National Park to Petra, Jordan,
            these beautiful places feature jaw-dropping architecture and natural wonders. So renew
            your passport, buy some quality luggage, and get to planning your summer vacation with
            our list below.
